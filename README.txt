Scheduler.py

Allows users to input their daily schedule. User inputs the tasks they must complete in
a day, how long the tasks will take and when the tasks need to be completed by. The
program then asks when the person wants to start their day.  With this information the
program then uses the EDD (Earliest Due Date) Schedulability Test to tell the user
whether their tasks are schedulable or not.  If their tasks are schedulable the
program computes EDD and prints out the order in which the user should perform
the tasks in order to finish them optimally and on time.
